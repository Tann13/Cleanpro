# Understanding pH in Professional Cleaning

## What is pH?
The pH scale ranges from 0 to 14:
- 0-6.9: Acidic
- 7: Neutral
- 7.1-14: Alkaline (Basic)

## Common Cleaning Products and their pH Levels

### Acidic Cleaners (pH 0-6.9)
- Toilet Bowl Cleaners (pH 1-3)
  - Best for: Removing mineral deposits, rust stains
  - Safe on: Porcelain, ceramic
  - NEVER use on: Natural stone, marble, concrete

- Vinegar Solutions (pH 2-3)
  - Best for: Glass, descaling coffee makers
  - Safe on: Glass, stainless steel, tile
  - NEVER use on: Natural stone, marble, granite

- Bathroom Cleaners (pH 4-6)
  - Best for: Soap scum, water spots
  - Safe on: Tile, fiberglass, acrylic
  - NEVER use on: Unsealed grout, natural stone

### Neutral Cleaners (pH 7)
- Floor Cleaners
  - Best for: Hardwood, luxury vinyl, laminate
  - Safe on: Most surfaces
  - Why use: Won't strip finishes or damage sealants

- General Purpose Cleaners
  - Best for: Daily cleaning of all surfaces
  - Safe on: Most surfaces
  - Why use: Gentle yet effective for regular maintenance

### Alkaline Cleaners (pH 7.1-14)
- All-Purpose Cleaners (pH 8-10)
  - Best for: Greasy soils, general dirt
  - Safe on: Most hard surfaces
  - Use caution on: Wood, some metals

- Degreasers (pH 11-12)
  - Best for: Kitchen hoods, engines, heavy grease
  - Safe on: Metal, concrete
  - NEVER use on: Wood, painted surfaces

- Oven Cleaners (pH 13-14)
  - Best for: Baked-on food, carbon deposits
  - Safe on: Oven interiors
  - NEVER use on: Aluminum, decorative metals

## Safety Guidelines

### Personal Protection
- Always wear gloves when using products at pH extremes
- Use eye protection with strong acids or bases
- Ensure good ventilation
- Never mix cleaning products

### Surface Protection
1. Always test in an inconspicuous area first
2. Know your surface material before selecting cleaners
3. When in doubt, use a neutral cleaner
4. Keep dwell time within manufacturer recommendations

### Emergency Procedures
- Skin contact: Rinse immediately with water for 15 minutes
- Eye contact: Flush with water and seek medical attention
- Ingestion: Do not induce vomiting, seek immediate medical help
- Spills: Neutralize acids with baking soda, bases with vinegar

## Pro Tips
1. Keep pH test strips in your cleaning kit
2. Start with the mildest effective cleaner
3. Document which products work best for specific situations
4. Consider environmental impact when selecting products

## Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Mixing bleach (basic) with vinegar (acidic) creates dangerous chlorine gas
- Using acidic cleaners on natural stone will etch the surface
- Applying high-pH cleaners to waxed floors will strip the finish
- Leaving acidic cleaners on metals can cause corrosion

## Best Practices for Different Environments

### Residential
- Use neutral to mildly alkaline cleaners for general cleaning
- Reserve strong acids/bases for specific problems
- Consider pets and children when selecting products

### Commercial
- Focus on safety and efficiency
- Document cleaning protocols and pH levels used
- Train staff on proper product selection

### Healthcare
- Follow facility guidelines for approved pH levels
- Document all cleaning product applications
- Maintain strict sanitization protocols

## Product Storage and Handling
1. Store acids and bases separately
2. Keep products in original containers
3. Label all diluted solutions with pH information
4. Maintain MSDS sheets for all products
